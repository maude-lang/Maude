	* buchiAutomaton.cc (simulationReduction): handle construction of
	new automata
	(simulationReduction): we have a subtle bug in that if the
	simulationReductionStep merely permutes the colors, we think
	nothing has changed and build the new automaton using out of date
	neighborhood data in the current color set. This bug is provoked
	when we start with a coloring of accepting = 0 because then state
	0 gets color 1. So for a quick fix we swap the roles of 0 and 1 in
	initial coloring
	(simulationReductionStep): need to return true if the number of
	colors increases even in the partial order does not
	(BuchiAutomaton): loop over sccOptimizations() and
	simulationReduction() to fixed point
	(simulationReduction): need check for increase in number of colors
	here rather than in simulationReductionStep()
