2024-01-24  Steven Eker  <eker@pup>

2023-09-20  Steven Eker  <eker@pup>

	* filteredVariantUnifierSearch.hh (class FilteredVariantUnifierSearch): update
	comment to agree with the change that we no longer always pass the

	dagToNarrow (in which indices must be preserved) and blockerDags (which
	VariantSearch will reindex, possibly many times)

2023-03-13  Steven Eker  <eker@pup>

	* narrowingSearchState.cc: don't initialize withExtension

	* variantUnifierFilter.cc (VariantUnifierFilter::insertUnifier): take the range

	(UnificationProblem::bindFreeVariables): get name for new variable
	from old variable
	(UnificationProblem::bindFreeVariables): delete the code for the
	destructiveUpdate case

	* unificationProblem.hh (class UnificationProblem): data member

2020-12-03  Steven Eker  <eker2@eker10>

	* narrowingSequenceSearch3.cc: added hack to compute sorts in

	bus error in the mark pahse of garbage collection
