Alpha 157 release notes
========================

Bug fixes
==========

(1) A bug where some garbage output of the form
  symbol = <structured constant>  color =
was printed to stderr when generating the LaTeX for a structured
constant, owing to some temporary debugging code being left in.
The debugging code attempts to print a null char* and on Macs this
causes an internal error. Discovered in an example provided by Paco.

(2) A bug in a pathological case where Maude will print a view that
it cannot then parse; illustrated by:

fth T is
  sort Elt .
  op f : Elt -> Elt .
endfth

fmod M is
  sort Foo .
  op term : Foo -> Foo .
endfm

view V from T to M is
  sort Elt to Foo .
  op f to (term) .
endv

show view .
show processed view .

Here the parentheses around term, needed to avoid ambiguity with
operator to term mappings, are removed in both cases, leaving the
unparsable view:

view V from T to M is
  sort Elt to Foo .
  op f to term .
endv

(3) A bug where the backquotes were stripped from a complex variable name
in the LaTeX output for show mod:

fmod FOO{X :: TRIV} is
  sort Foo .
var `[`] : Foo .
endfm

show mod .

(4) A bug where a complex operator/message names were printed without backquotes
or enclosing parentheses in ops/msgs declarations in the LaTeX output for show mod:

omod FOO is
  sorts Foo Bar .
  ops f ([_]) : Foo -> Foo .
  msgs m `[_`] : Bar -> Msg .
endom

show mod .

(5) Many case where the complex operator/message names were printed without backquotes
or enclosing parentheses in contexts where they would be ambiguous, in the LaTeX output
for various commands:

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op ({:}) : -> Foo .
  op [to] : -> Foo .
endfm

show mod .
show desugared .

fmod BAR is
  inc FOO * (op ({:}) to (c[]), op ([to]) to ({,})) .
endfm

show mod .
show desugared .

(6) A bug in the LaTeX code that can cause a crash on strange constant names
that are not structured constants.

./maude -latex-log=num.tex

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op [.] : -> Foo .
endfm

show mod .

(6) A bug where 

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  ops ([_]) (:) : Foo -> Foo .
endfm

show mod FOO .

produced

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  ops `[_`] : : Foo -> Foo .
endfm

which doesn't parse.

(7) A bug where executing a new command in the debugger could cause bad
LaTeX output (though the LaTeX output for debugging and tracing is not
currently supported). Reported by Paco and illustrated by:

debug red true and true .
red false and false .

Other changes
==============

(1) Operators having mixfix syntax with mismatched parentheses now generate
a warning and the mixfix syntax is disabled. Although declaring such operators
with separate tokens has never parsed it is possible to declaring them
with backquote syntax:

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op `(_`)`) : Foo -> Foo .
  op `)_`( : Foo -> Foo .
  op a : -> Foo .
endfm

Previously it was possible to get Maude to output mixfix syntax for
them that would not reparse:

red `(_`)`)(a) .
red `)_`((a) .

(2) Previously integer exponents and left shifts were limited to 1,000,000 to avoid
inadvertently runing out of memory. The limit is now ULONG_MAX (9,223,372,036,854,775,807
on 64-bit hardware, 4,294,967,295 on 32-bit hardware) which is a hard limit imposed
by GMP, although as before, if the first argument is 0, 1 or -1 for exponentiation
or 0 for left shift, then the answer is trivial and arbitrary second arguments can
be handled. Change requested by Dwight Guth <dwight.guth@runtimeverification.com>

(3) The printing of operators outside of terms has been revised to match the limitations
of the surface parser and to avoid introducing backquotes where possible:

(a) In op/msg declarations, parentheses will be placed around any operator containing
the ":" token outside of parentheses. Tokens containing ":" such as "_:_" don't count.
(b) In ops/msgs declaration, parentheses will be placed around any operator containing
multiple tokens and the unique operator ":".
(c) In renamings and views, parentheses will be placed around any from-operator containing
containing the tokens ":" or "to" outside of parentheses.
(d) In renamings, parentheses will be placed around any to-operator containing the
tokens "," or "[" outside of parentheses.
(e) In views, parentheses will be placed around any to-operator starting with the token
"term" or containing the token "." outside of parentheses.
(f) In op-hooks, operators containing the token ":", whether inside or outside of
parentheses will be printing as single tokens, using backquotes if necessary.

These conventions avoid ambiguity in the surface syntax and are used for both text
and LaTeX output. Note that op-hooks are not intended to be written by regular users
and have a very restricted syntax, and in particular sort names in op-hooks must always
be a single token, using backquotes where needed for structured sort names.
