Alpha 153 release notes
========================

Bug fixes
==========

(1) A bug where the ctor attribute was not being printed correctly for
polymorphic operators in LaTeX output. Illustrated by:

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op f : Foo Universal -> Foo [poly (2) ctor] .
endfm

show desugared .

(2) A bug where the LaTeX for the filter and delay keywords was printed
using \maudeKeyWord rather than \maudeKeyword. Reported by Rubén.

(3) A bug where show processed view did not put a space after the keyword
var (or vars) in the LaTeX output.

(4) A bug where the LaTeX output for the strategy top had an extra open
parenthesis.

(5) A bug where the LaTeX output for show processed view was showing class and
attribute mappings rather than the sort and op mappings they are transformed
into.

New features
=============

(1) There is a new command
  set print label attribute on/off .
which controls whether statement labels are printed as statement attributes:
  eq a = b [label aMap] .
or as old style prefixes:
  eq [aMap] : a = b .
When statement attributes were introduced in 2008, statement labels became
just another statement attribute and we switched from the second form to the
first form for printing, with both forms are accepted by the parser. However the
second form seems more popular in practice so it is now used for printing
labels in parsed statements by default. The new set command controls both for
terminal and LaTeX renderings for commands such as show rules, show all, show
desugared etc.

In unparsed statements, both forms are just part of the bubble of unparsed
tokens and show module just displays the bubble of tokens.

(2) The maude.sty package now has a option, ASCII:

\usepackage[ASCII]{maude}

The effect is to use combinations of ASCII symbols in place of math symbols
so that LaTeX output corresponds character for character with terminal output.

(3) There is now LaTeX support for
  show mod <module name> .
or equivalently
  show module <module name> .
Note that as this shows the unparsed module, hooks, identity terms,
membership axioms, equations, rules, and strategy definitions are just
bubbles of tokens which are printed using the \maudeRaw{} command which uses
the typewritter font.
Also parameterized sorts and constants in renamings in module expressions
are just printed using the naive \maudeSort{} rather than as a structured
name with \maudeParameter{} and \maudeView{} since they haven't been evaluated
to determined what is a parameter and what is a view name.

(4) This is a new command
  set clear module caches on/off .
that controls whether things suchs a meta-module and meta-op caches
are cleared when a module loses focus (i.e. goes from being the current
module to not being the current module). The default is on for backward
compatibility. Requested by Dwight Guth <dwight.guth@runtimeverification.com>.

(5) This is a new command
  set print hooks on/off .
that controls the printing of the special attribute. The default is on
but if off is chosen, the hooks are omitted and replaced by an ellipsis;
for example:

  op s_ : Nat -> NzNat [ctor iter prec 15 gather (E) special (...)] .

This is supported for show module, show desugared, show all and show ops
in both text and LaTeX.

(6) There is now LaTeX support for
  show view <view name> .
Note that as this shows the view module, terms on either side of op to
term mappings and strategy expressions on either side of strat to expr
mappings are just bubbles of tokens which are printed using the \maudeRaw{}
command which uses the typewritter font.

(7) There is a new command
  set print combine vars on/off .
which controls whether each variable alias is printed on its own line
or whether variable aliases with the same sort are combined in a
single declaration. This flag is supported for show desugares/all vars
The default is off for backward compatibility.

Other changes
==============

(1) The pretty printing of statements is slightly more sophisticated
about where it inserts sort disambiguation. Consider:

mod FOO is
  sorts Foo Bar .
  ops a b 0 : -> Foo .
  op 0 : -> Bar .
  cmb 0 : Bar if 0 : Foo .
  ceq a = 0 if b = 0 .
  crl b => 0 if a => 0 /\ b := 0 .
endm

show desugared .

Here, previously, each occurrence of 0 required disambiguation. Now
the right hand sides of =, => and := are assumed to have a known
kind based on the left hand side, while the left hand side of : is
assumed to have a known kind base on the sort in the rhs so none of
the occurrences of 0 recieve sort disambiguation.

(2) A similar change to the printing of operator identities since
the range kind will always be defined by the operator.

(3) The output of show module has been cleaned up:
(a) It now prints "sort" rather than "sorts" if there is only one sort on
the line.
(b) It now prints "subsort" rather than "subsorts" if there is only one
subsort relation being declared on the line.
(c) It now prints "subclass" rather than "subclasses" if there is only
one subclass relation being declared on the line.

(4) The tilde character ~ which in LaTeX normally appears at the top of
the character box is centered in the -latex-log= output.

(5) Changes to how complex operator names are displayed for show desugared.
Previously backquotes were only removed in the LaTeX version of operator
declarations. They are now removed in:
(a) LaTeX version of operator renamings.
(b) LaTeX version of op hooks

(6) The default formatting for mixfix syntax now puts a space after
a comma token for both text and LaTeX output but only if no explicit
format statement is in play. The operator 
  op _,_ : AttributeSet AttributeSet -> AttributeSet [ctor assoc comm id: none format (d d s d)] .
in mod CONFIGURATION now has its format attribute removed as it
is superfluous. The old behavior of not putting a space after comma
is the default if a format statement is in play so can be obtained using
d in the position after the comma; but of course this can always be
overrided by using s or some other spacing format command:

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op [_,_] : Foo Foo -> Foo [format (d d d d d d)] .
  ops a b c d e : -> Foo .
endfm

red [a, [[b, c], d]] .

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op [_,_] : Foo Foo -> Foo [format (d d d s d d)] .
  ops a b c d e : -> Foo .
endfm

red [a, [[b, c], d]] .

The format attributes in the prelude have been updated to reflect this,
with d replaced by s where necessary.

(7) Previously portals were represented by an inert constant
  op <> : -> Portal [ctor] .
The requirement that a configuration communicating with external
objects contain a portal was merely to avoid the degenerate case of
a lone object waiting for a reply from an external object, which
would not be received because object-message rewriting and external
object interaction is special behavior that is attached to the
configuration contructor
  op __ : Configuration Configuration -> Configuration [ctor config assoc comm id: none] .
With a portal present, this operator will always appear at the top
of a configuration that communicates with external objects.
Other than this corner case, the requirement for a portal was not
enforced.

Now we take portals seriously, and only configurations having a portal
are allow to exchange messages with external objects. This means that
an message from an external object will only be delivered to a
configuration that contains an object with the target Oid and a portal.
Configurations are ephemeral - they can be split and merged by arbitrary
rewriting and they do not have an identifier so this rule is needed
to determined where a message from an external object should be delivered.

The change to enforcing the portal requirement allows the use of objects
in different configurations that have the same Oid and as long as only
one such configuration has a portal, messages from external objects
will not be misdelivered. This requirement arises with nested
configurations where the outer configuration manages communication
between external objects and objects in the inner configurarion and
objects in both configurations share Oids. In this case only the outer
configuration would have a portal and would be able to communicate
directly with external objects.

The change also means that portals can no longer be arbitrary inert
constants - the system has to know that a given constant is a portal.
Thus the portal in CONFIGURATION is declared
  op <> : -> Portal [ctor portal] .
using a new attribute portal. Of course this new attribute is also
reflected at the metalevel by a new constant
  op portal : -> Attr [ctor] .

(8) Previously there was some variation in order in which operator
attributes were printed; polymorphic operators vs non-polymorphic
operators, show desugared vs show module, and text vs LaTeX. We now use
a uniform order:

poly
ctor
assoc, comm, id: (may be prefixed by left or right), idem, iter
pconst
obj, msg, portal, config
strat, memo, frozen
prec, gather, format
metadata
special
ditto

A further wrinkle is that when printing message declarations, the
ctor and msg attributes are implied by the message declaration and
so are not printed.

(9) In the model checker, the satisfaction relation is now declared to
be partial:
  op _|=_ : State Prop ~> Bool [frozen] .
The rationale is that the user is only required to ensure it reduces
to true in the positive case and it can return any old junk in the
negative case. Declaring it to be partial means it returns a result
in the kind [Bool] rather than sort Bool, thus protected BOOL (as it
is declared in fmod SATISFACTION). This change is purely semantic and
has no operational effect. Requested by Jose.

(10) The LaTeX output now allows line breaks after the single character tokens
  ( [ { ,
and before the single character tokens
  ) ] }
in mixfix syntax. This greatly reduces the overfull \hbox issue and
approximates the line breaking rules used by the line wrapper in the text case.

(11) In LaTeX output only for show all/desugared/ops, backquotes are not shown
in op-hooks (they haven't been shown in op declarations for a while). I'm
considering making this the convention for text output in the future, for
both op-hooks and op declarations but there are some subtle cases for reparsing
output.
