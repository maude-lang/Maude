Alpha 156 release notes
========================

Bug fixes
==========

(1) A bug where certain characters in metadata resulted in bad LaTeX being
produced by show mod. For example:

fmod FOO is
  sort Foo .
  op b : -> Foo [metadata "`'\\^'"] .
endfm

show mod .

(2) A bug where rewriting in a condition has a side effect on flags in
a dag that causes strategic rewriting with nonexec rules to fail.
Illustrated by this example from Paco:

mod NONEXEC is
  sorts Foo Bar .
  ops a b : -> Foo [ctor] .
  op <_> : Foo -> Bar [ctor] .
  vars F G : Foo .
  crl < F > => < G > if F => G /\ F =/= G .
  rl [ab] : a => b [nonexec] .
endm

srew < a > using try(all) ; ab .

Here the try(all) strategy on < a > attempt to use
  crl < F > => < G > if F => G /\ F =/= G .
and in particuar tries to rewrite the subterm a using executable rules.
When it fails, a is marked as being unrewritable as an optimization.
Then attemption to rewrite with the label ab, rewriting fails, even
though the nonexec rule can be used with this strategy, because a is
marked as being unrewritable. The fix is that flags that indicate a
subterm is unrewritable, or should not be explored (unstackable) are ignored
if nonexec rules are in play.

New features
=============

(1) The resouces information printed on exit with
  set show resouces on .
is now supported in LaTeX.

(2) LaTeX support for more commands:
(a) smt-search
(b) check
(c) loop and loop mode bubbles

(3) There is a new search arrow, =>#, which searches for states having multiple
distinct successors. For example:

mod TEST is
  sort Foo .
  ops a b c d e f : -> Foo .
  rl a => b .
  rl b => c .
  rl c => d .
  rl c => e .
  rl d => e .
  rl d => f .
endm

search a =># X:Foo .

This is only supported for search, and not for smt-search or any version of
narrowing. At the metalevel, the Qid '# is used to indicate this search type.
Feature requested by Dwight Guth <dwight.guth@runtimeverification.com>.

(4) Printing dags in graph from with
  set print graph on .
is now supported in LaTeX.

Other changes
==============

(1) Large numbers, strings of sort String as well as strings occurring in metadata and
print attributes, Qids and unparsed tokens in show mod and show view are now allowed
to be broken over multiple lines in LaTeX to avoid an "Overfull \hbox".

(2) Various changes to LaTeX spacing.

(3) Equations having both the variant and nonexec attributes now produce an advisory,
and are ignored for variant generation.

(4) Directories and other non-regular files are no longer considered for
reading with the directives in, load and sload. This is to avoid
  load .
attempting to read in the current directory as if it were a Maude file.
Change requested by Carolyn.

(5) The maximum line length when using Tecla is increased from 1024 characters
to 100 * 1024 characters. Change requested by Paco.

(6) The amount of history kept by Tecla is increased from 4 KB to 100 KB.

(7) The narrow command now respects frozen positions just like the vu-narrow command.
